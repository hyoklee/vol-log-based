## Log-layout based VOL - an HDF5 VOL Plugin for storing datasets in a log-based layout

This software repository contains source codes implementing an
[HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org) Virtual Object Layer
([VOL](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Virtual+Object+Layer)) plugin
that stores HDF5 datasets in a log-based storage layout in files. When using
this VOL, multiple write requests from an MPI process are appended one after
another (as logs) and stored in a contiguous block in the file. The contiguous
blocks of multiple processes are appended one another following the processes'
MPI rank order. Such log-based I/O strategy avoids the expensive inter-process
communication which is required when storing data in the canonical order.
Thus, exist HDF5 programs, through the log-based VOL, can achieve a better
parallel write performance with no changes to their codes. Files created by
this VOL conform with the HDF5 file format, but require this VOL to read them
back.
